# RRedis

RRedis is a very simple implementation of Redis in Ruby. It doesn't aim to implement all of it or to
be production ready. It is purely for educational purposes to explore how to implement something
like Redis.

## Installation

Install it via

    $ gem install rredis

Then run it with `rredis`

## Usage

TBD

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `./bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `./bin/rake test`
to run the tests. You can also run `./bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `./bin/rake install`. To release a new version,
update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `./bin/rake release`, which will create a
git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
